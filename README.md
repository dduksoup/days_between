# days_between

This originated as part of an exercise for the Intro to Computer Science
course at Udacity.

The code was originally designed to take 6 inputs (2 dates - earlier year,
month, day and later year, month, day) and calculate the number of days
that exist between the two dates, while accounting for leap days.
