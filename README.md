# days_between

----------------
Introduction
----------------
This originated as part of an exercise for the Intro to Computer Science course at Udacity.

The code was originally designed to take 6 inputs (2 dates - earlier year, month, day and later year, month, day) and calculate the number of days that exist between the two dates, while accounting for leap days.

I was asked to accomplish the task while using a limited number of predefined functions (for the sake of the lesson).  Hopefully, the code will improve significantly as I progress past beginner-level skills in lists, dicts, and tuples.
